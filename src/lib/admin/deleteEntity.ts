 * Generic admin "Delete" for the seven entities that have a real detail
 * page: SOPs, Domains, Frameworks, Controls, Checklist templates, Audits,
 * CAPAs. Gated to admin/compliance by the caller (canDeleteOrArchive) —
 * this module assumes the permission check already happened.
 *
 * Every entity here has FK dependents (see sql/*.sql). Most relationships
 * are ON DELETE SET NULL — the dependent row survives, just orphaned —
 * but a few CASCADE (real data loss: a checklist template's questions, an
 * audit's responses) and one RESTRICTs (a template still used by an audit
 * can't be deleted at the DB level at all). getDeleteImpact() surfaces
 * that distinction so the confirmation dialog can show it truthfully
 * instead of a generic "are you sure?".
