 * department manager's domains follow their department the moment either
 * changes, instead of needing a parallel manual mapping kept in sync.
 * Any pre-existing user_domains rows still count too (belt-and-braces for
 * data written before this change), but new grants never come from there.
 *
 * Brand scope works the opposite way on purpose: an EMPTY brandIds means
 * "no brand restriction" (all brands), not "no brands visible" — see the
 * brandIds doc comment below and the one call site that reads it
 * (audits/new). Assigning specific brands narrows it; the admin UI no
 * longer offers that picker either, so in practice this is always empty
